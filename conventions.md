This course focuses on DevOps, and not how to program. While we will explore real-world sample program, and construct a CI/CD pipeline around it; I will not be overly-focused on the programming underlying technology. For your assessment, and to fully understand the in-class examples, you will need to explore the underlying technology in your own time.

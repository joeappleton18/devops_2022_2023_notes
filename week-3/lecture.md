This week, we will complete the static analysis rung of the CI pipeline. In doing so, we'll add code formatting to the room-checking sample application. Further, we'll put in place checks to ensure that code that does not comply with our linting and formatting rules does not end up in our codebase.

Throughout this week, we will be addressing the following questions:

1. How can we ensure that a team follows a consistent coding standard?
2. How can we enforce these standards?
3. How can we integrate these standards into our CI/CD pipeline?
4. How can I deploy my web applications?

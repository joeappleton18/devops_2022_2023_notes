Welcome Welcome to week five. This week promises to be interesting: we are going to be expanding our CI pipeline by beginning to add automated tests to our room finder application.

Throughout this week, we will be addressing the following questions:

1. What is the purpose of software testing?
2. How can I create user focused tests?
3. How can I start to develop a testing strategy for my own applications?

Please watch the lecture before the session:

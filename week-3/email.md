 subject: DEVOPS (Week Three On Demand Lecture)


Hello, Dev (opsers),

Welcome to Week 3.  

This week we will be completing the static analysis rung of our CI pipeline. 

[Please ensure you watch the weekly lecture video (it's only 10 minutes).](https://joeappleton18.github.io/devops_2022_2023_notes/week-3/lecture.html) 

[Further, if you have not done so already, complete the side tutorials](https://joeappleton18.github.io/devops_2022_2023_notes/side-tutorials/1.creating-a-next-and-tail-wind-application.html)

I look forward to seeing you in the practical,

Joe

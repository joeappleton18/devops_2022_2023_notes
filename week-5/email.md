Hello [:name],

Welcome Welcome to week five. This week promises to be interesting: we are going to be expanding our CI pipeline by beginning to add automated tests to our room finder application. 

[Please take some time to watch the quick lecturer video for this week](https://joeappleton18.github.io/devops_2022_2023_notes/week-5/lecture.html)

Regards, 

Joe

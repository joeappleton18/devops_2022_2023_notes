# Week 10: Monitoring and Logging 

We are nearly there! Recall, way back in week-1, I introduced the basic principles of DevOps:

- Continuous Integration
- Continuous Delivery/Deployment
- Infrastructure as Code
- Monitoring and Logging
- Communication and Collaboration


## What to Measure? 


There are several measurement techniques that can be used in a DevOps environment to monitor and improve the performance and reliability of software systems. These techniques include:

1. Monitoring: Continuous monitoring of key metrics, such as system performance, availability, and error rates, can provide teams with real-time insights into the health and stability of their systems.

1. Dashboards: Dashboards can be used to visualize key metrics and to provide teams with an overview of the current state of their systems.

1. Log analysis: Log analysis can be used to identify trends and patterns in system behavior, and to quickly identify and diagnose issues.


1. Continuous feedback: Continuous feedback from customers and users can provide valuable insights into the performance and usability of a system, and can help teams to continuously improve the quality of their software.

By using these measurement techniques, teams can gain a better understanding of their systems, and can use this information to make informed decisions about how to improve the performance and reliability of their software.

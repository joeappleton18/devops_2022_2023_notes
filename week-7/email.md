subject: DEVOPS (Week Seven On Demand Lecture)


Hello Everyone,

The latest version of our room finder application now has authentication; this raises a few DevOps concerns that we will address this week:

1. How do we test our application when it is locked down? 
2. How do we manage authentication across different environments?	

[Further, we can also upload room images through the image provider Cloudinary;  this raises the further question:](https://cloudinary.com/)

3. How do we facilitate third-party providers, such as Cloudinary, across different environments?


There is no lecture this week; instead, [you should make a start on the the latest side tutorial]())

See you all in the practicals,

Joe

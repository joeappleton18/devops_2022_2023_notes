subject: DEVOPS (Week Two On Demand Lecture)

Hello,

Welcome to week two. 

This week promises to be particularly interesting. We will be looking at how to perform static code analysis on our JavaScript code base. Further, we will explore how to ensure consistent code formatting, even with multiple developers working on a single code base. 

Before the practical: 

Ensure you watch the brief introductory lecture. 

- If you have time, complete the next side tutorial.

- I look forward to seeing you all this week, 

Joe

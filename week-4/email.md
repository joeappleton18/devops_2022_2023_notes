Hello, Devopsers,

I hope you are all well.

This week, we are going to be continuing with CI. In doing so, I will show you how we can build and test application components in isolation.  

I've not recorded a formal lecture this week. However, I have made the next installment of the side tutorial, connecting-to-a-database, which you should watch. In this tutorial, I explore the full-stack capabilities of Next.js by connecting to a MongoDB database to store and retrieve rooms. It's a long tutorial (about one hour), so you probably won't be able to watch it in one sitting. 

In closing, I do appreciate this module presents a steep learning curve. However, by working in groups, we can pool our knowledge. Trust me, the technologies and techniques I teach you are well worth knowing. 

I look forward to seeing you all in the practicals,

Joe

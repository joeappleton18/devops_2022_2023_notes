# Managing Database in a CI/CD Environment 

This week, we will consider how to write reliable integration tests when the goal is to manipulate a database.  Specifically, we will be addressing the following questions: 

1. How can I set up a test database?
1. How can I integrate tests into my CI/CD pipeline?

There is no lecture this week; instead, [you should make a start on the the latest side tutorial](https://joeappleton18.github.io/devops_2022_2023_notes/side-tutorials/4.mutating-a-database.html#part-1-overview-everyone-should-watch-this)

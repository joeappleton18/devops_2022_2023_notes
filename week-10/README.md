# Week 10: Monitoring and Logging 

We are nearly there! Recall, way back in week-1, I introduced the basic principles of DevOps:

- Continuous Integration
- Continuous Delivery/Deployment
- Infrastructure as Code
- Monitoring and Logging
- Communication and Collaboration


## What to Measure? 


There are several measurement techniques that can be used in a DevOps environment to monitor and improve the performance and reliability of software systems. These techniques include:

1. Monitoring: Continuous monitoring of key metrics, such as system performance, availability, and error rates, can provide teams with real-time insights into the health and stability of their systems.

1. Dashboards: Dashboards can be used to visualise key metrics and to provide teams with an overview of the current state of their systems.

1. Log analysis: Log analysis can be used to identify trends and patterns in system behavior, and to quickly identify and diagnose issues.

By using these measurement techniques, teams can gain a better understanding of their systems, and can use this information to make informed decisions about how to improve the performance and reliability of their software.

This week, I would like to quickly introduce a few methods to gain a better understanding of our room tracking application.

## Code Coverage

::: tip Definition Code Coverage

Code coverage is a measure of how much of your code is executed when running tests. It helps you determine how thoroughlyyour tests exercise your code, and helps you identify areas of your code that may not be fully tested. By ensuring that your tests have high code coverage, you can improve the quality and reliability of your software.
